# Project Short Squeeze

## Description

Project Short Squeeze is a tool designed to screen data and compile potential short squeeze information into a database for further analysis. A short squeeze occurs when a heavily shorted stock experiences a rapid increase in price, forcing short sellers to cover their positions, which can lead to a further upward momentum in the stock.

This project aims to gather relevant data, such as short interest, trading volume, and price movement, and store it in a database for analysis and identification of potential short squeeze opportunities. By analyzing this data, users can make informed investment decisions.

## How to Run

To run the Project Short Squeeze application, follow the instructions below:

1. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Fill out the necessary environment variables in the file. These variables may include database credentials, API keys, or other configuration parameters.
3. Once the environment variables are properly configured, build the Docker Compose file.

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

4. After the build process is complete, you can start the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will start the necessary services and components defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

5. Access the Project Short Squeeze application by navigating to the specified URL or port in your web browser.

## Additional Information

- Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system before running the application.
- The `docker-compose.yml` file contains the necessary configurations to run the application in a containerized environment.
- Feel free to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to suit your specific needs, such as specifying volumes or exposing different ports.
- Ensure that you have the required API keys or access permissions for any external services used by the application.
